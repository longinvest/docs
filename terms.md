If you’re using our Services for an organization, you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

### Your Stuff & Your Permissions

When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email address and so on (“Your Stuff”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like editing, organizing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require our systems to access, store Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with.

### Your Responsibilities

Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don’t have access to it, and keep your account information current.

You agree not to misuse the Services. For example, you must not, and must not attempt to do the following:

- probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;

- access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of the Services, or shared areas of 
the Services you haven’t been invited to;

- sell the Services or Services accounts via unauthorized channels;

- use automated or other means to create accounts in bulk or to access the Services other than by using our official interface and/or APIs;

### Software

Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

### Our Stuff

The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other China and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, logos and other brand features.

We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.

### Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

When permitted by law, we will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. The total liability of us is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services.

### Links To Other Web Sites

For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you’re not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others’ use of the Services. Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven’t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We’ll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.

### Modifications

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page).

By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
